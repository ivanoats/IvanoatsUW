So I've been trying out a few different shells. I just feel that the command
line could be a lot better. It could have a more useful, more modern user interface.
 This is important because I'm using it about 8 hours day - most of the time
I'm on the computer. And despite the large amount of stuff I know regarding the
terminal, and my ever increasing collection of dotfiles, it still kind of feels 
like I'm on an improved [VAX](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/digital/timeline/1988-2.htm).

First up was [TermKit](http://acko.net/blog/on-termkit/). Looks [awesome](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6Z5dnlfcls&feature=player_embedded). Also, looks [abandoned](https://github.com/unconed/TermKit/commits/master). Oh well. I'll check back in a while to see if anyone has forked and improved it.

Next up was [FishFish](http://ridiculousfish.com/shell/beta.html). Looks great! It includes syntax highlighting, advanced tab completion features, discoverable help, a revised shell syntax and many other features. Downside is that it has a largely 
different and incompatible syntax than bash. I was worried about running other people's
scripts, and developing my own that could not be used by anyone else, or at least a small
installed user base of fish. Still, the fish userbase seems to be growing.
