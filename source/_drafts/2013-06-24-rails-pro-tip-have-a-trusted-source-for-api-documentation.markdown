When coding you'll frequently run into the question: *"How the hell do I do this?"*

Well, I'm not going to answer that for you. **Figure it out**. (屮ಠ益ಠ)屮

But, I can give you a tip about these questions:

- What the freak does this method do?
- Why am I not seeing the results I expected from this method?
- What is this "Error Wrong Number of Arguments"

Short answer: [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM)! Google is NOT always
your friend!

Long answer: Ok, seriously, but, how to read the manual? Which manual? One tip
that will save you some time is, have a favorite "manual", a trusted source for
documentation that is your #1 go-to.

Luckily, with Ruby, this is easy.
